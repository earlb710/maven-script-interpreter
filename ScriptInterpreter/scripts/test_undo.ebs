// Test script for custom undo functionality
// 
// How to test the custom undo manager:
// 
// 1. BASIC UNDO/REDO TEST:
//    - Open this file in the script editor
//    - Type some text in the editor (syntax highlighting will be applied)
//    - Press Ctrl+Z to undo - it should undo only the text you typed, not the highlighting
//    - Press Ctrl+Y to redo - it should redo the text change
//
// 2. WORD-LEVEL UNDO TEST:
//    - Type the word "print" (5 characters)
//    - Press Ctrl+Z once - it should undo the entire word "print", not just the last character
//    - Type "hello world" (two words with a space)
//    - Press Ctrl+Z once - should undo "world"
//    - Press Ctrl+Z again - should undo "hello "
//
// 3. FIND BAR TEST (Ctrl+F should NOT clear undo history):
//    - Type some text in the editor
//    - Press Ctrl+F to open find bar - highlighting will be applied to matches
//    - Close the find bar (press Esc or click Close button)
//    - Press Ctrl+Z - it should undo the text you typed, NOT be cleared
//
// 4. SEARCH HIGHLIGHTING TEST:
//    - Type more text - the search highlights should not interfere with undo
//    - Press Ctrl+Z - it should undo the text you just typed, not the search highlighting
//
// Expected behavior:
// - Undo/redo should only affect text changes, not style/highlighting changes
// - Undo should work at word-level (undo entire words, not individual characters)
// - Cursor should stay at the correct position after undo/redo
// - No cursor jumping to top of document
// - Search highlighting should not pollute the undo stack
// - Opening/closing find bar (Ctrl+F) should NOT clear undo history

var string message = "Hello, World!"
print(message)

// Type more text below this line and test undo...
